Embed any link from the web easily as a beautiful Content Card.

== Description ==

Content Cards make ordinary web links great by making it possible to embed a beautiful Content Card to link to any web site.

By using OpenGraph data, Content Cards grabs the title, description and associated image to the links you embed - it's similar to how you can embed other websites, such as YouTube, Twitter, SoundCloud and more.

For individual links, You can insert a Content Card via shortcode: `[contentcards url="http://yoursite.com/article-1"]`. If you often use Content Cards for a particular website, you can register the domain name (for example: `yoursite.com`) as an oEmbed provider via the Content Cards plugin Settings page and then it will behave the same way other oEmbed providers do - you will just have to paste a plaintext link in a separate paragraph and a Content Card will be generated automatically.

This plugin was built by [Arūnas Liuiza](http://arunas.co) and [Stanislav Khromov](http://snippets.khromov.se/). It is being developed on [GitHub](http://github.com/ideag/content-cards).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

There are two ways of inserting Content Cards into WordPress posts - shortcode or oEmbed.

= Shortcode =

Using a shortcode is the simplest way - simply put the shortcode `[contentcards url="http://yourdomain.com/article/1"]` into your post content and it gets replaced with a content card.

The shortcode accepts two attributes:

* `url` (requried) - link to the site you want to display Content Card for.
* `target` (optional) - if you want force links to open in new tab, use `target="_blank"` the same you would in actual links. This overrides the global option in Content Cards Settings page.

You can also insert the shortcode via a button in your visual editor. Start by pressing the Content Cards icon in WordPress visual editor's (TinyMCE) toolbar. If no other plugins are adding their buttons, our button should be the last one in the top toolbar.

= oEmbed = 

If you find that you are adding a lot of Content Cards from some single domain, you can save yourself some work, by white-listing that website as oEmbed provider in Content Card Settings page.

White-listed sites work the same way any other oEmbed provider in WordPress (YouTube, Twitter, SoundCloud, etc.) - you simply need to put a plaintext link on a separate line in the WordPress editor and it will be replaced with a Content Card. 

In Content Cards Settings page you can provide a list of white-listed sites. Input the domain name (i.e. `example.com`), one domain per line.

= Skins = 

Content Cards come with two default skins - `Default` and `Default Dark` - created by Stanislav Khromov. These skins are designed to provide minimal structural styling and blend in nicely with active theme by inheriting the font styles from the theme.

All skin template files can be found in the `content-cards/skins/` directory and they can be overwritten by creating a template with the same name in the currently active theme. For example, if you want to overwrite the Content Cards stylesheet, you should add `content-cards.css` to your theme directory.

the main skin template is `content-cards.php`. If no other skin templates are defined, Content Cards will fall back to this one, the same way WordPress falls back to the `index.php` template. If you want more granular templates, you can provide `content-cards-{$type}.php` templates, (`content-cards-website.php`, `content-cards-article.php`, etc.). The `$type` variable is based on the `og:type` tag provided by the website.

Content Cards provides five template tags which are usable in the template files:

* `get_cc_data( $key, $sanitize = false )` - **returns** `$key` OpenGraph data field (i.e. 'title', 'description', etc.). If valid `$sanitize` function is provided, the data is escaped using it.
* `the_cc_data( $key, $sanitize = false )` - according to WordPress tradition, it **prints** the same data that `get_cc_data()` would return.
* `the_cc_target()` - a special helper function, that prints ` target="_blank"` to links if needed (according to plugin/shortcode settings). Usage: `<a href=""<?php the_cc_target() ?>>`.
* `get_cc_image( $size, $sanitize = false )` - *new in v0.9.1* - returns a link to image if there is one. Defaults to image, cached in Media Library, then to remote image. For cached images, you can use `$size` parameter to get specific WordPress image size.
* `the_cc_image( $size, $attrs = array() )` - *new in v0.9.1* - prints an image tag. Uses `get_cc_images()`.

Since `v0.9.1` you can use `'favicon'` key in `get_cc_data()/the_cc_data()` to display favicon if the remote site provides one.

= Requirements =

This plugin requires WordPress Cron to be in proper working order.

= Override the default options =

If you are running this plugin on a multisite, you may wish to set site-wide settings and disable the Content Cards settings page on each separate blog.

To do this, you can use the `content_cards_options` hook, like this:

    add_filter('content_cards_options', function($data) {

        //Disable admin page
        $data['enable_admin_page'] = false;

        return $data;
    });

You can also override a number of other options using this hook. For example, here we set the theme to "default-dark":

    add_filter('content_cards_options', function($data) {

        //Disable admin page
        $data['skin'] = 'default-dark';

        return $data;
    });
